* Simulation of ILC on NL system
    - Got ILC converging when system = BLA (L = 0.5)
    - Use same ILC on nonlinear system, still convergence!

    - Try easier system, build up. 1) Static NL 2) Small Dynamics 3) Full W-H
    - Work in Z - domain
    - use as SysRef = BLA -> better performances
** 12 Feb 2015 (part 2)
    - implemented as discrete time -> NL dist even if only linear filter?
** 13 Feb 2015
    - Problem was in transients removal -> fixed
    - creation of 2 test systems (SNL and WH)
    -  uj = Q*(uj + e); works better for SNL, but fails on WH

    - Feedback without BLA works better -> because BLA is only defined on little frequency band, cannot compensate!
    - Thank note : filterbuddy FTW.

    - To get BLA out of the excited band 
        1) parametric identification, but extrapolation is dangerous!
        2) Tickler tone, use small signal outside of band of interest, small -> less NL dist
