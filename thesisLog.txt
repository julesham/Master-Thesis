* Simulation of ILC on NL system
    - Got ILC converging when system = BLA (L = 0.5)
    - Use same ILC on nonlinear system, still convergence!
** 12 Feb 2015
    - Try easier system, build up. 1) Static NL 2) Small Dynamics 3) Full W-H
    - Work in Z - domain
    - use as SysRef = BLA -> better performances
** 12 Feb 2015 (part 2)
    - implemented as discrete time -> NL dist even if only linear filter?
** 13 Feb 2015
    - Problem was in transients removal -> fixed
    - creation of 2 test systems (SNL and WH)
    -  uj = Q*(uj + e); works better for SNL, but fails on WH
** 17 Feb 2015
    - Feedback without BLA works better -> because BLA is only defined on little frequency band, cannot compensate!
    - Thank note : filterbuddy FTW.
** 18 Feb 2015
    - To get BLA out of the excited band 
        1) parametric identification, but extrapolation is dangerous!
        2) Tickler tone, use small signal outside of band of interest, small -> less NL dist

    - Two BLA measurements compared with eachother have a difference of -40 dB, because of stochastic MS
        - adding a tickler should not increase this difference
    - Energy in main freq band should be the same!
** 24 Feb 2015
    - Wanted output should also be passed trough BLAT
** 02 Mar 2015
    - Deprioritize the complete frequency band compensation, focussing on band of interest
    - Added noise, affects performance but not stability , maybe because of low-pass effect of BLA only being defined in BOI and zero outside of this.
** 03 Mar 2015
    - It works, but why? What nonlinear levels are acceptable?
    - Comparison with other methods
    - Transient in ILC, add some periods
** 04 Mar 2015
    - Added Transient periods to ILC
** 10 Mar 2015
	- Measurements are probably out of phase, keep the measurements to check!
	- Check influence of reference or input 
** 12 Mar 2015
    - Rik Pintelon : some measurements are delayed with one sample, so all measurements are not synchronized, averaging makes no sense!
** 16 Mar 2015
    - John Lataire : dude, you are an engineer, shift your data
	- Jules : Ok John, it works now, halleluja!
** 18 Mar 2015
    - Measurements work! Check connections toroughly!
** 19 Mar 2015
    - Try with higher BW and different rms
** 23 Mar 2015 
    * try Y_ref = K*U_ref and compare with BLA
    * tickler + parametric
    * non-linear identification
