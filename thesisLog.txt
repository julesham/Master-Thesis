* Simulation of ILC on NL system
    - Got ILC converging when system = BLA (L = 0.5)
    - Use same ILC on nonlinear system, still convergence!

    - Try easier system, build up. 1) Static NL 2) Small Dynamics 3) Full W-H
    - Work in Z - domain
    - use as SysRef = BLA -> better performances
** 12 Feb 2015 (part 2)
    - implemented as discrete time -> NL dist even if only linear filter?
